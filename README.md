# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks-Plasma-Physics
This repository contains all the code, outputs and loss logs for different PINNs used during SRI Program 2025 at DAU. 

## Aim 
The aim for this project is to systematically approach the use of PINNs in general problem solving and with the long-term goal being to create a publically available python module for the use of PINNs capable of solving all kinds of problems including 
- Analytical and numerical solvers to have a benchmark
- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Partial Differential Equations
- Advanced initial and boundary conditions
- Other advanced PINN models that can be used to solve complex systems and higher order differential equations

## In this project 
We have solved various problems like 
- Non-linear pendulum position forecasting
- Simple ODE
- Continuity equation
- Burgers' equation
- Vlasov-Poisson system of equations
